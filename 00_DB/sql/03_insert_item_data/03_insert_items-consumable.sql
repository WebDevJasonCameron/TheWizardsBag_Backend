                Each cardâ€™s effect is described below.

                *Balance.* You can increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 22, provided you also decrease another one of your ability scores by 2. You canâ€™t decrease an ability that has a score of 5 or lower. Alternatively, you can choose not to adjust your ability scores, in which case this card has no effect.
                *Comet.* The next time you enter combat against one or more Hostile creatures, you can select one of them as your foe when you roll Initiative. If you reduce your foe to 0 Hit Points during that combat, you have Advantage on Death Saving Throws for 1 year. If someone else reduces your chosen foe to 0 Hit Points or you donâ€™t choose a foe, this card has no effect.
                *Donjon.* You disappear and become entombed in a state of suspended animation in an extradimensional sphere. Everything youâ€™re wearing and carrying disappears with you except for Artifacts, which stay behind in the space you occupied when you disappeared. You remain imprisoned until you are found and removed from the sphere. You canâ€™t be located by any Divination magic, but a Wish spell can reveal the location of your prison. You draw no more cards.
                *Euryale.* The cardâ€™s medusa-like visage curses you. You take a âˆ’2 penalty to saving throws while cursed in this way. Only a god or the magic of the Fates card can end this curse.
                *Fates.* Realityâ€™s fabric unravels and spins anew, allowing you to avoid or erase one event as if it never happened. You can use the cardâ€™s magic as soon as you draw the card or at any other time before you die.
                *Flames.* A powerful devil becomes your enemy. The devil seeks your ruin and torments you, savoring your suffering before attempting to slay you. This enmity lasts until either you or the devil dies.
                *A Question of Enmity*
                Two of the cards in the Deck of Many Things can earn a character the enmity of another being. With the Flames card, the enmity is overt. The character should experience the devilâ€™s malevolent efforts on multiple occasions. Seeking out the fiend shouldnâ€™t be a simple task, and the adventurer should clash with the devilâ€™s allies and followers a few times before being able to confront the devil.
                In the case of the Rogue card, the enmity is secret and should come from someone thought to be a friend or an ally. As Dungeon Master, you should wait for a dramatically appropriate moment to reveal this enmity, leaving the adventurer guessing who is likely to become a betrayer.
                *Fool.* You have Disadvantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours. Draw another card; this draw doesnâ€™t count as one of your declared draws.
                *Gem.* Twenty-five pieces of jewelry worth 2,000 GP each or fifty gems worth 1,000 GP each appear at your feet.
                *Jester.* You have Advantage on D20 Tests for the next 72 hours, or you can draw two additional cards beyond your declared draws.
                *Key.* A Rare or rarer magic weapon with which you are proficient appears on your person. The DM chooses the weapon.
                *Knight.* You gain the service of a Knight, who magically appears in an unoccupied space you choose within 30 feet of yourself. The knight has the same alignment as you and serves you loyally until death, believing the two of you have been drawn together by fate. Work with your DM to create a name and backstory for this NPC. The DM can use a different stat block to represent the knight, as desired.
                *Moon.* You gain the ability to cast Wish 1d3 times.
                *Puzzle.* Permanently reduce your Intelligence or Wisdom by 1d4 + 1 (to a minimum score of 1). You can draw one additional card beyond your declared draws.
                *Rogue.* An NPC of the DMâ€™s choice becomes Hostile toward you. You donâ€™t know the identity of this NPC until they or someone else reveals it. Nothing less than a Wish spell or divine intervention can end the NPCâ€™s hostility toward you.
                *Ruin.* All forms of wealth that you carry or own, other than magic items, are lost to you. Portable property vanishes. Businesses, buildings, and land you own are lost in a way that alters reality the least. If you have a Bastion (see the Dungeon Masterâ€™s Guide), it is destroyed by some calamity beyond your control. Any documentation that proves you should own something lost to this card also disappears.
                *Sage.* At any time you choose within one year of drawing this card, you can ask a question in meditation and mentally receive a truthful answer to that question.
                *Skull.* An Avatar of Death appears in an unoccupied space as close to you as possible. The avatar targets only you with its attacks, appearing as a ghostly skeleton clad in a tattered black robe and carrying a spectral scythe. The avatar disappears when it drops to 0 Hit Points or you die. If an ally of yours deals damage to the avatar, that ally summons another Avatar of Death. The new avatar appears in an unoccupied space as close to that ally as possible and targets only that ally with its attacks. You and your allies can each summon only one avatar as a consequence of this draw. A creature slain by an avatar canâ€™t be restored to life.
                *Star.* Increase one of your ability scores by 2, to a maximum of 24.
                *Sun.* A magic item (chosen by the DM) appears on your person. In addition, you gain 10 Temporary Hit Points daily at dawn until you die.
                *Talons.* Every magic item you wear or carry disintegrates. Artifacts in your possession vanish instead.
                *Throne.* You gain proficiency and Expertise in your choice of History, Insight, Intimidation, or Persuasion. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world. However, the keep is currently home to one or more monsters, which must be cleared out before you can claim the keep as yours.
                *Void.* Your soul is drawn from your body and contained in an object in a place of the DMâ€™s choice. One or more powerful beings guard the place. While your soul is trapped in this way, your body is inert, ceases aging, and requires no food, air, or water. A Wish spell canâ€™t return your soul to your body, but the spell reveals the location of the object that holds your soul. You draw no more cards.',

       'Typically found in 1d4 pots inside a fine wooden box with a brush (weighing 1 pound in total), these pigments allow you to create three-dimensional objects by painting them in two dimensions. The paint flows from the brush to form the desired object as you concentrate on its image.
            Each pot of paint is sufficient to cover 1,000 square feet of a surface, which lets you create inanimate objects or terrain features--such as a door, a pit, flowers, trees, cells, rooms, or weapons-- that are up to 10,000 cubic feet. It takes 10 minutes to cover 100 square feet.
            When you complete the painting, the object or terrain feature depicted becomes a real, nonmagical object. Thus, painting a door on a wall creates an actual door that can be opened to whatever is beyond. Painting a pit on a floor creates a real pit, and its depth counts against the total area of objects you create.
            Nothing created by the pigments can have a value greater than 25 gp. If you paint an object of greater value (such as a diamond or a pile of gold), the object looks authentic, but close inspection reveals it is made from paste, bone, or some other worthless material.
            If you paint a form of energy such as fire or lightning, the energy appears but dissipates as soon as you complete the painting, doing no harm to anything.',
